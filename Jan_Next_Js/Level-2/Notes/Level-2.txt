- A route Group can be created by warpping a folder's name in the paranthesis: (folderName)

- This convention indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should not be included in the route's URL paranthesis

- In next Js every component is server component so if you want to use hooks (useState.. etc), you have to write
'use client' at the top of the page.
